> Plan: Based on the research results, I will revise the report to include new information about Linux and how it is better than Windows. I will add sections explaining what Linux is, how it came into existence, and how it compares to Windows. Finally, I will add the necessary references to support the new information.

# ðŸ¤” What is Linux?
## ðŸŒˆ An Open-Source Operating System
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. It is a family of Unix-like operating systems that includes the kernel, along with supporting system software and libraries[^1^]. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and servers[^2^].

## ðŸ¤– How Linux Came Into Existence
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, who released the first version of the Linux kernel on September 17, 1991. Torvalds developed Linux as a hobby project while studying computer science at the University of Helsinki. He wanted to create an operating system that was similar to the Unix operating system but was free and could be modified by anyone[^2^]. Over the years, Linux has evolved with contributions from a global community of developers, resulting in a robust and feature-rich operating system.

## ðŸš€ Why Linux is Better Than Windows
Linux offers several advantages over Windows, making it a preferred choice for many users:
- Open Source: Linux is open-source, which means that the source code is freely available and can be modified by anyone. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility.
- Stability and Security: Linux is known for its stability and security. The open-source nature of Linux allows for constant scrutiny and improvement, resulting in a more secure and reliable operating system.
- Customization: Linux offers a wide range of customization options, allowing users to tailor their operating system to their specific needs.
- Software Compatibility: Linux supports a vast array of software applications, including popular productivity tools, development environments, and multimedia software.
- Cost: Linux is often cheaper to use than Windows, as many Linux distributions are free and open-source, while Windows requires a license fee.

In conclusion, Linux is an open-source operating system that offers stability, security, and flexibility. It was created by Linus Torvalds and has evolved through the contributions of a global community of developers. Linux has several advantages over Windows, including its open-source nature, stability, security, customization options, software compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.
